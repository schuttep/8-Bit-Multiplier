SystemVerilog Tetris Implementation
This project implements the classic Tetris game using SystemVerilog. The focus is on replicating the core mechanics of Tetris, including block movement, rotation, and line clearing, while optimizing the game logic for hardware performance. The design integrates with an SoC to interface with peripherals and display the game on a pixel map.

Features
Game Logic: Complete Tetris mechanics, including block movement, rotation, line detection, and clearing.
Pixel Map Display: Efficient use of a pixel map stored in memory for the game grid, ensuring fast and smooth display updates.
SoC Integration: Interfaces with external peripherals, including display and input devices, to provide a playable experience.
Optimized Memory Usage: Utilizes block memory for game state storage, improving timing and reducing latency.
