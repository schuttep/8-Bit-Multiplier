Introduction:  
	This lab focused on the creation of a HDMI Text Mode Controller with an AXI4 interface.  The HDMI interface works by using several pieces of information that it receives such as font, coordinates, color, inversion. For lab 7.1 it received only inversion in the most significant bit and character bits. In lab 7.2 we got more complex receiving inversion information, character information, and color information. We then converted the data received into pixel values which we then converted into the HDMI format and using the AXI4 interface is sent to the output screen. In lab 6.2 we created a simple MicroBlaze design to interact with our different slaves. We utilized this by making the HDMI text controller a slave that received and sent data using the MicroBlaze.  One of the man advantages of the lab 7 approach is that all our IP is part of our system and therefore was easier to integrate with our system. The main drawback was that designing the custom IP was very time consuming and required a much deeper understanding of how everything worked in conjunction with each other.
